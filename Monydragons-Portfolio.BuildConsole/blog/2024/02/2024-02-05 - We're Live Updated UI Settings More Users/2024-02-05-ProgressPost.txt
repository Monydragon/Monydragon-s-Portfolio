📲 Day 36 of #CodeADay: Menu Makeovers & Chat Characters! Today, Stormi Dragon and I dove into a creative spree for 'We're Live', focusing on user experience and dynamic interactions. 🖥️👾

👩‍💻👨‍💻 Today's Creative Endeavors:
✅ Revamped the main menu, giving it a fresh, intuitive update for an improved first impression.
✅ Continued our quest for the perfect game balance, tweaking and tuning to ensure every player faces a fair challenge.
✅ Began crafting a diverse cast of chat users, each with their unique dialogues, to enrich the streaming simulation experience.

🗓️ Progress Update: 2024-02-05

Our journey today was all about enhancing how players interact with 'We're Live' - from the moment they hit the main menu to the lively exchanges with virtual chat users. It's these details that bring the game world to life.

🚀 Looking Forward:
As we expand the universe of 'We're Live' with more characters and fine-tune the gameplay, our excitement for sharing these updates grows. Stay tuned for more as we breathe life into the game, one line of code at a time.
