🎲 Day 45 of #CodeADay: Crafting Narratives & Gameplay Loops! Today, Stormi Dragon and I delved deeper into the heart of our Brackey's Game Jam project, focusing on the narrative paths and the core gameplay mechanics. 💡📚

👩‍💻👨‍💻 Collaborative Design Efforts:
✅ Together, we embarked on laying out the story paths, ensuring a rich and engaging narrative for our reverse murder mystery game.
✅ Dedicated time to defining the core gameplay loop, focusing on creating a compelling and replayable experience for players.
✅ Engaged with our team to outline requirements and dive into asset hunting, gathering everything needed to bring our vision to life.

🗓️ Progress Update: 2024-02-14

Valentine's Day was spent in the spirit of collaboration and creativity, weaving together the elements that promise to make our game unique. With each decision and design, we're closer to presenting a game that challenges players to think differently and engage deeply.

🚀 Moving Forward:
As we solidify our game's foundation and work closely with our team, the excitement builds. Our journey through the Brackey's Game Jam is a testament to the power of teamwork and shared vision. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to craft an experience that we hope will captivate and intrigue.
