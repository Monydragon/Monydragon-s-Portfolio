Dive into the first chapter of our year-long coding adventure! Mony Dragon and Stormi (Niki Miller) from Dragon Lens Studios have embarked on a challenge to develop every single day of 2024, and we're excited to share our progress with you.

This January, we've made significant strides on 🐾 Puppy Tasks, a .NET MAUI app designed to streamline your daily tasks with a touch of fun, and 🎮 We're Live, a streamer simulator game created during the Global Game Jam that puts you in the shoes of a Twitch streamer navigating the highs and lows of live streaming.

👀 Watch our journey, the challenges we faced, the victories we celebrated, and what's next for us. This dev log is just the beginning!
