🛠️ Day 40 of #CodeADay: Leveling Up & Diving Back! Stormi Dragon and I had a productive day fine-tuning 'We're Live' and revisiting 'Puppy Tasks'. 🎮🐾

👩‍💻👨‍💻 Today's Coding Conquests:
✅ Focused on integrating and setting up various difficulty levels in Unity for 'We're Live', ensuring each offers a unique challenge.
✅ Ensured that the levels were meticulously configured, promising a seamless experience across different intensities.
✅ Stormi returned to the world of 'Puppy Tasks', our beloved .NET Maui project, diving into code enhancements and bug squashing.

🗓️ Progress Update: 2024-02-09

Splitting our focus today allowed us to push forward on two fronts. In 'We're Live', we're closer to delivering a game that caters to all players, while 'Puppy Tasks' continues to evolve into a more polished and user-friendly app.

🚀 Forward Momentum:
As we balance our efforts between these two exciting projects, our journey of development continues to be one of discovery and improvement. Stay tuned for more updates as we make strides in game development and app creation.
